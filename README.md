It defines the application's functional and technical requirements, serving as the foundation for test planning and execution.

b) Test Plan Document:
The test plan is a clear guide for testing, covering what will be tested, the scope, inclusions, and exclusions.
It explains the testing process, defect reporting, schedule, tools, and deliverables. It also outlines risks, entry and exit criteria, and the approval process.

The RTM links each requirement to its test cases to ensure complete coverage.
It includes details like requirement IDs, descriptions, related test scenarios, test cases, and their status.

STEPS: 
1. Understanding the Website
 I began exploring the website thoroughly to understand its purpose, structure, and features.
As a tester, I believe it is crucial to understand the client's website thoroughly especially when no documents or information are provided.

2. Creating Test Scenarios
Based on my observations of the website, I created detailed test scenarios.
I then refined these scenarios to ensure they were optimized. 
For example : I merged common functionalities across all pages into a single test scenario wherever possible.
This approach helped me cover all aspects of testing efficiently.

3. Writing and Executing Test Cases
After finalizing the test scenarios, I started writing detailed test cases for each scenario.
I systematically executed each test case making sure the coverage of all functionalities, UI elements, and responsiveness as per the task requirements.
